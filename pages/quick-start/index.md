The *Quick Start* aims to introduce the JDemetra+ 2.2 software, which 
enables the user to perform seasonal adjustment and other operations. 
Two seasonal adjustment methods are implemented: 
[X-12-ARIMA/X-13ARIMA-SEATS](https://github.com/Immurb/TestWiki/wiki/Ref 
erence-Manual#X13) developed at the U.S. Census Bureau, and 
[TRAMO/SEATS](https://github.com/Immurb/TestWiki/wiki/Reference-Manual#T 
RAMO-SEATS) developed by Victor Gómez and Agustín Maravall, from the 
Bank of Spain. The *Quick Start* gives working instructions on how to 
install and launch the software. It includes a step-by-step description 
of how to perform the first analysis with JDemetra+. The dataset used to 
illustrate the JDemetra+ functionalities is accessible 
[here](http://www.cros-portal.eu/content/jdemetra-quick-start-0) and can 
be used to replicate the results presented in the document. 

The *Quick Start* is intended for beginners, who have only a basic 
knowledge of seasonality and its estimation in time series. Therefore, 
the case study included in this document is a basic one. For an 
explanation of each step of more advanced examples refer to the [*Case studies*](../case-studies/).
Information about the JDemetra+ software and its functionalities is included in the 
[*Reference Manual*](../reference-manual/).

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with time series related 
concepts. Readers with insufficient background to follow this document 
are encouraged to refer to an appropriate textbook, e.g. CHATFIELD 
(2004). Some background knowledge about seasonality in the time series 
can be gained from the [e-learning courses on Seasonal 
Adjustment](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/sa-elearning). 

The *Quick Start* neither describes in detail how the seasonal 
adjustment methods work, nor the underlying mathematics. For those 
readers interested in studying seasonal adjustment methods, brief 
sketches of the X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO/SEATS algorithms and concepts 
as well as a bibliography are included in this Wiki.
