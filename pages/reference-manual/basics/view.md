The View menu contains functionalities allowing for customising the view of an application to the user needs. It offers the following items:
* **Split** – the function is not operational in the current version of the software.
* **Toolbars** – displays selected toolbars under the main menu. The File toolbar contains the Save all icon. The Performance toolbar includes two icons: one to show the perfor-mance of the application, the other to stop application profiling and take a snapshot. The Other toolbar determines the default behaviour of the program when the user double clicks on the data. It may be useful to plot the data, visualise it on a grid, or to perform any pre-specified action, e.g. execute a seasonal adjustment procedure.
* **Show Only Editor** – displays only the Results panel and hides other windows (e.g. Workspace and Providers).
* **Full Screen** – displays the current JDemetra+ view in the full screen.
