Workspace is a JDemetra+ functionality that stores the work performed by 
the user in a coherent and structured way. By default, each workspace 
contains the pre-defined modelling and seasonal adjustment 
specifications and a basic calendar. A specification is a set of 
modelling and/or seasonal adjustment parameters. Within the workspace 
the following items can be saved:
* User-defined modelling and seasonal adjustment specifications; 
* Documents, that contain results from time  series modelling and seasonal adjustment;
* User-defined calendars; 
* User-defined regression variables. 


Together with the results from modelling and seasonal adjustment, also the original data, paths to the 
input files and parameters of processes are saved. Therefore, these 
results can be re-opened, updated, investigated and modified in the next 
sessions with JDemetra+. 

The workspace saved by JDemetra+ includes: 
* Main folder containing several folders that correspond to the different 
types of items created by the user and; 
* The xml file that enables the 
user to import the workspace to the application and to display its 
content.

An example is shown in the figure below.

The workspace can be shared with other users, which eases 
the burden of work with defining specifications, modelling and seasonal 
adjustment processes.

The content of the workspace is presented in the 
*Workspace* window. It is divided into three sections: 
* Modelling (contains the default and user-defined specifications for modelling; and the output from the modelling process) 
* Seasonal adjustment (contains the default and user-defined specifications for seasonal adjustemnt and the output from the seasonal adjustment process),
* Utilities ([calendars](calendars.html) and [user defined variables](user-defined-variables.html)).
